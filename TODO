Changes in the process of being completed
=========================================
1) Tried to set up global variables, but fails
2) The “do you want to quit” message is resizable and should not be (I think this is a GTK+ issue, not my app)
3) Maybe more? I coded these with "ZZZ"
4) Need Help file content
